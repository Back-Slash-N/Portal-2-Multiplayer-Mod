// * Permissions stack with increased admin level
// * The highest admin level available is [6] and is assigned automatically to the server operator (unless it's a dedicated server)
// * Everyone by default has level [0]
//
// * These can be accessed with "!" preceding them
// * Use "!help (commandname)" to print a description of each command in the chat box
//
// [0]: "help", "changeteam", "kill", "playercolor", "vote"
// [1]:
// [2]: "kill (someone)"
// [3]: "playercolor (for someone else)", "rocket (optionally someone)"

// isn't possible with .mp3 files. Those marked with "Doesn't loop", are some tracks we thought would be nice to be
// there by default, but they don't loop.
//
// There needs to at least one specified track for things properly to work, this can be a empty string but if you 
// don't want music just set musicDefault to zero.

# Building the Launcher

## Dependencies

- Python 3.10
- pygame
- requests
- steamid-converter

We also have them in a file for easy install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Compiling

We use `pyinstaller` and `AppImage` to make the executables!

### Windows:

For windows we only use [pyinstaller](https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/) to build the executable (if you know of better options please tell us).

```shell
pyinstaller "src/MainWindow.py" -F -i "src/GUI/images/p2mm64.ico" --noconsole --add-data "src/GUI;GUI" --add-data "src/Languages;Languages"
```

### Linux:

For Linux we switched to using [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) and we made a tool to help with that, simply have `docker` installed and run `./tools/build-docker.sh` while in the root directory.

***WARNING! For some reason on some Linux distributions, FUSE is not installed by default which is needed for both compiling and running AppImages. Information for installing FUSE on your distribution can be found here: [AppImageKit's Wiki](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE)***

If you don't want to use AppImage/docker, you can still use pyinstaller:

```shell
pyinstaller "src/MainWindow.py" -F --add-data "src/GUI:GUI" --add-data "src/Languages:Languages"
```

### Notes:

- If you want to fork the project and do your own releases you need to change the variables at the top of `src/Scripts/Updater.py` to your own information and update the values in `AppImageBuilder.yml`

# P2:MM Plugin

The Portal 2: Multiplayer Mod uses a separate Source Engine server plugin in order to hook on to Portal 2 to patch the game and allow certain systems to operate that VScript normally can't do. The plugin has been put into a separate repository due to the nature of the development and compiling environment of Source Engine plugins. You can find its source code here: <https://github.com/OrsellGaming/Portal-2-Multiplayer-Mod-Plugin>

# Contributions

Portal 2: Multiplayer Mod version `2.3.0` will be our definitive version, so we won't make any significant updates after it is fully released. Before this happens, we will work on minor updates leading to the full version. We will accept any substantial changes or features for P2:MM during this period. However, we will not accept any more significant changes after the full release. The only reasons we would make a new release would be when someone contributes a new translation, an improvement of a current translation, some other minor bug fix we didn't catch, or a map support file for a workshop map. We will only make another release under those circumstances and will no longer accept anything significant into this repository. However, you can still fork it to build off our work! Please make sure you give credit to this repository!
